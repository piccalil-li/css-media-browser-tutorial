# CSS media browser tutorial

This is the supporting repo for [Build a responsive media browser with CSS](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-responsive-media-browser-with-css).

This runs off a little eleventy setup. To get started:

1. Run `npm install`
2. To serve locally: `npm start`
3. To build: `npm run build`

For both serving and building, the output is `dist`.
